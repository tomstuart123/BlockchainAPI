# BlockchainAPI

I thought it would be fun to use Javascript to pull blockchain.com data and visualise it in a front-end using the chart.js library. 

The charts are super janky as chart.js - I've since learned Python and this is 100x easier - but are still running after 2 years or so which is nice.
